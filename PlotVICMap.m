function h = PlotVICMap()

% Plot a map of VIC results

% FLUXES contains the time series and entries for each thing. I want to plot a map given the coordinates. I should structure this after the MODWET work from DA class.

% It would probably be useful to have a coordinates object.

% The following lines extract the names from the FLUXES structure:
for k=1:ncells
	FLUXES

	
end
